Final Project
Mini Golf Course

How to Make it Work:
 * n = switch between holes
 * v = change between orthogonal and perspective
 * f = go into first person and leave
 * w,a,s,d - only active in first person
   * w = move closer
   * a = decrease angle
   * s = move farther away
   * d = increase angle
 * -,+,arrows - only active when not in first person
   * - = decrease fov
   * + = increase fov 
   * arrows = change view angle 
 * control the light
   * l/L = toggle light
   * m/M = toggle light movement
   * </> = move light
   * [/] = change light elevation
   * a/A = ambient level
   * d/D = diffuse level
   * s/S = specular level
   * e/E = emission level
   * h/H = shininess level   
 * 0 = reset to original view settings
 * PgDn/PgUp = zoom in and out (fn & up/down arrow keys on mac)
 * esc = exit scene

Why this is an A:
 * I have spent countless hours working to make sure everything is precise.
 * On the second hole I made sure to follow the curves of the course and line the 	
   border appropriately to those curves.
 * I have achieved my goal of building two courses.
 * There’s limited repetition on the course layout, I had to construct each piece 
   individually.
 * The windmill took a lot of time and shows knowledge of movement.
 * The ferris wheel also shows a knowledge of movement and my ability to expand 
   on the windmill technique to make something new.
 * I have worked very hard to make this pleasing to look at and fun
 * I have used all kinds of different shapes from quads, triangles, circles, 
   circular disks, spheres, cones, torus, and cylinders.
 * Each of those shapes have the correct normals and are also texture mapped correctly
 * I have also made a few of my own textures, while not a part of the code aspect, 
   shows I went above to make sure my project was visually pleasing.
 * I have made five “fun” objects
   * These include the windmill, ferris wheel, ice cream cart, ring toss, and golf clubs.
   * Each of these I am very proud of because I think they are pretty cool.
   * This objects are made up of all different kinds of shapes - these are not simple objects.
 * All in all, I think my project looks really great, and I am really proud of my work.
