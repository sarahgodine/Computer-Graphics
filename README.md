Mini Golf Course

This was created using C code. I did not use any Glut or Glu Objects to create my shapes.

How to Make it Work:
 * n = switch between holes
 * v = change between orthogonal and perspective
 * f = go into first person and leave
 * w,a,s,d - only active in first person
   * w = move closer
   * a = decrease angle
   * s = move farther away
   * d = increase angle
 * -,+,arrows - only active when not in first person
   * - = decrease fov
   * + = increase fov 
   * arrows = change view angle 
 * control the light
   * l/L = toggle light
   * m/M = toggle light movement
   * </> = move light
   * [/] = change light elevation
   * a/A = ambient level
   * d/D = diffuse level
   * s/S = specular level
   * e/E = emission level
   * h/H = shininess level   
 * 0 = reset to original view settings
 * PgDn/PgUp = zoom in and out (fn & up/down arrow keys on mac)
 * esc = exit scene
